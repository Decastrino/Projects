Assignments/04-Scheduling:
--------------------------

Implementation of a job scheduler to handle jobs and processes using python 3 and the OS module library.


Mini shell project:
------------------
Mini shell project for a basic OS class implementing basic commands such as LS, CAT, WC, PWD, MV, CP, CHMOD e.t.c


Graph Traversal:
----------------

GPU PROGRAMMING 
DEPTH FIRST TRAVERSAL OF A GRAPH USING THE GPU 

High performance computing is a growing branch of computer science, and can be applied to many fields, especially fields in which data can get really large in areas like graph processing, data mining, data processing etc. This project compares the sequential depth first traversal of a graph using the CPU with one executed in parallel using the GPU. All nodes in the system traverse all other nodes in parallel as opposed to the sequential approach explored by the CPU where traversals are done one after the other through the use of loops and recursion which becomes costly as data grow larger. In this project, we tend to harness the potential of the GPU as problem size increases. Analysis and graphs are drawn and the outcome shows the effectiveness of high performance computing where more work is done effectively in lesser amount of time.
